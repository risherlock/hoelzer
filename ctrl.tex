\section{The control problem and the required control circuits}

The long range rocket V-2 was designed to transport its warhead to a target about 250 km away. It was to reach this target as an unpropelled projectile after the thrust had been cut off. Simple calculations showed that the maximum range for a given velocity at all-burnt was obtained with an angle of 49$^\circ$ between trajectory tangent and the vertical. Because of the starting weight of 12.5 tons, the normal type of inclined launching ramp would have been too heavy. Thus the rocket had to undergo a change of direction after launching; for this a control loop, the so-called pitch control, was required.

Furthermore, a control in yaw had to be incorporated, for without this the rocket would have deviated too much from its intended trajectory in the lateral direction.

A third control loop was required to suppress the natural tendency of the rocket to roll due to structural inaccuracies. It was not permissible to let the V-2 roll, because, as we shall see later, the control equipment contained gyros.

In order to obtain the desired range, the thrust — after the end of the directional change — had to be cut off when the rocket had reached a predetermined velocity. For this purpose, a device had to be developed by which the velocity of the rocket could be measured and the fuel shut down, when the ``all-burnt-velocity" had been reached. Fig. 1 shows the first part of a trajectory of a V-2 rocket.

\section{The control equipment for the standard series}

\subsection{The automatic pilot for yaw, pitch, and roll}

For the directional control of the rocket, the automatic pilot with gyros as used in aircraft readily suggested itself. We shall consider the control in yaw first. A potentiometer attached to a gyro produced a voltage proportional to the angle between the actual and intended direction of the axis. The voltage, via a stabilizing network and two amplifiers in parallel, operated a couple of servo units (Fig. 2).

The particular difficulties in designing the control circuit were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Only a velocity servo was available as a servo drive, since at that time it was used in aircraft.
  \item The aerodynamic forces varied considerably during flight. The velocity of the rocket and the density of the air varied by several orders of magnitude, and the distance between the centre of pressure and the centre of gravity by a factor of 10.
\end{enumerate}

However, a solution was found, in with a passive network was used and the amplification as well as the transfer function of amplifier and network were kept constant from start to all-burnt, this being extremely desirable for technical reasons. In order to avoid tedious repetition we shall consider at a later stage Low this solution was found.

The degree of feed-back was chosen so high that the control circuit was just sufficiently damped throughout the control time. This is not a priori the best solution: an accelerated unguided rocket veers into the wind, whereas a guided rocket with a high degree of feed-back in its controls drifts with the velocity component of the wind normal to the assigned trajectory. Therefore there is a certain degree of feed-back for which the wind has no influence on the lateral motion. Calculations, however, showed that for all disturbing forces occurring laterally, the accuracy in yaw was best in the case of highest possible degree of feed-back in the control circuit.

Graphite controllers were used as control vanes in the venturi with, for reasons to be explained later, small air-vanes in parallel. Controllers in the venturi were used for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The relatively long time during which the rocket had to travel, because of its small initial acceleration, in order to develop at the air-vanes reaction forces sufficient to counterbalance wind and thrust unsymmetries, would have been sufficient to make the rocket turn through 90$^\circ$.
  \item The available hydraulic servo units were of rather low performance. It was therefore necessary to use well balanced controllers, i. e. of a type with a very small torque. It was not thought possible that within permissible: time air-controllers could have been developed which, for the whole velocity range (Mach number 0 to 6), would be sufficiently balanced.
\end{enumerate}

After many trials, graphite controllers of such a shape were developed for use in the venturi that, in spite of loss through burning, equilibrium was sufficiently- retained for the whole of the trajectory. One may say that the low performance of the servo units prevented the development of a really good yaw control circuit for the V-2.

The control in pitch was nearly identical with the control in yaw. Only the direction assigned to the roll axis (direction of course) was varied in time so that the desired direction of the trajectory and thus the desired change in direction was obtained. The direction of the course and the trajectory tangent were nearly identical in the case of the V-2-control systems. For the chosen trajectory the angle of attack remained always smaller than 3$^\circ$, and the angle between the axis of the rocket and its assigned direction never exceeded the same value because of the high degree of feed-back in the control circuit. The accurate calculation of the assigned direction from the desired trajectory tangent is not difficult.

In the first controlled rockets the direction of the course was changed by making the gyro precess by a signal (the precession axis was called D-axis). The direction of the course was the direction of the spin axis of the gyro. Later on, the pick-off pitch was given as angular deviation with respect to the rocket; in this method, which yields better results, the direction of the course differs from the axis of the gyro by this angular deviation.

The control circuit for roll was identical with the control in yaw up to the amplifier input, only the network was somewhat different. The output voltage of the network was fed into both amplifiers for yaw control, from which one feed line passed through a phase-inverter. The roll signal thus operated the yaw controllers in phase opposition. We now understand the purpose of the small additional air controllers: because of their small leverage about the longitudinal axis the effectiveness of the controllers in the venturi was not sufficient to counterbalance the moments in roll. It was found that even the additional air controllers had insufficient effect. Therefore a so-called ``Trimmsegclsteuerung" was built into the tail plane which, by way of a control circuit making use of integrated deviation, compensated continuous disturbances in roll. Fig. 3 shows a circuit diagram of the direction and roll control circuit. We see that a gyro, a so-called ``Vertikant", carried the yaw and roll pick-offs; the amplifiers and networks were combined in the so-called mixer unit (summing amplifier)

Fig. 4 shows the arrangement of the control vanes. The functioning of the trim vanes destabilizes the control in roll, but only to a permissible degree.


Special care has to be taken with regard to the correct position of the
assigned course during launching and flight. In order to satisfy the first
condition, the gyros were mounted on a kind of adjustable platform. The rocket
was adjusted so that the platform was in a horizontal position, and one of its
edges pointed towards the target (optical adjustment by collimator) (sec Fig. 5).
To make sure of the second condition, gyros were used, which in the laboratory
did not wander more than 0.1 to 0.2 degrees pcr minute under the influence
of gravity.

2.2.2. Description of the Two Systems
For the V-2 two different fuel shut-down systems were developed:
a) Utilisation of DOPPI.ER-Effect.
From the ground, a measuring frequency (meter wave length) was trans-
mitted to the rocket and from there, after doubling the frequency, reflected to
the ground. The beat frequency R, of the second harmonic of the measuring
frequency and the reflected wave is proportional to the rocket velocity in the
direction of the straight line joining the ground base with the rocket. The
comparator contained a WIF.N bridge which was tuned to a frequency At
corresponding to v t*— It',*. When the beat frequency passed through this
tuned frequency, a signal was transmitted to the rocket which operated the
relays. In order to measure the rocket velocity itself, transmitter and receiver
had to be positioned in the direction of the trajectory tangent at the instant
ol all-burnt.
b) Integration of the acceleration of the rocket.
Here one tried to measure the acceleration of the rocket dv/ldt in the
direction of the tangent of the trajectory, and the ascertained value was
integrated. Because of the gravitational acceleration one obtained the value

where § is the angle of inclination of the trajectory.
The first integral represents the rocket velocity, and therefore the second
term has to be calculated beforehand for the mean interval f,::" between start
and all-burnt, and then fed into the comparator

The correction is, as was stated above, only correct in the average. Another
inaccuracy is unavoidable; the accelerometer can be installed in the direction of
the rocket axis but not of the trajectory tangent. But considering the small angle
of attack, the error thus caused is only small.
Two different integrating devices were employed. The first (IG 1) utilized
the fact that a gyro under the influence of an acceleration processes at a
rate proportional to the acceleration. The angle of precession B i i r was pro-
portional to the integral with respect to time of all accelerations, i.e. the value
vx. The fuel cut-off signal was released when the gyro, reaching the angle of
precession A t i r, closed a properly adjusted contact. The second device (IG 2)
determined the velocity by means of a rotating pendulum fettered by an
electric current. When the pendulum moved from its zero position under the
influence of an acceleration, a bridge became unbalanced (Fig. 8). Thus a
s r Moving
Direction
of flight
Fig. 8. Scheme of the electronic device for integrating the velocity oj the missile
current was caused to flow in the moving coil whidi fettered the pendulum.
The condition of equilibrium was such that the torque caused by the acceleration
and the torque of the moving coil compensated each other. The moving-coil
current was also proportional to the acceleration. This current was integrated
by means of an electrolytic cell especially developed for this purpose The
charge R,,, of the cell during the flight is proportional to the velocity vs. Before
launching the cell was charged with An, in the opposite sense and caused fuel
cut-off when the charge H,i. — An. passed through zero.
Because of the required gravity correction, the IG-method is less accurate
than the radio method. The latter was to be preferred for another reason. By a
minor modification of the base M, the influence of errors of the trajectory
tangent angle i), on the range X can be eliminated. The equation
86
O. Muller, The Control System of the V-2
(2.4)
X = f(v l,i) l)
is more accurate than equation (2.1).
If il, is slightly different from its assigned value pj*,a velocity must be chosen
which, in its turn, is also slightly different from its assigned value in order to
obtain its correct range. Again wc have
(2-5)
X = f (V.r, Vy)
(v,r = v, cos 0, vu = vt sin &),
If vf and Vy differ only slightly from their assigned values, the following
equations holds:

Thus a given range depends only on the rocket velocity in the direction a. We
eliminate the influence of the angle of the trajectory tangent if wc position the
base M so that the straight line joining M and the rocket at the time of cut-off
contains the angle a (instead of />,*) with the vertical. A corresponding
correction is not possible with an integrating device fixed to the axis of the
rocket. The above partial derivatives were obtained from trajectory calculations.

It should however be said that the last IG-method results were somewhat
better than the last radio-method results. The reason for this somewhat
surprising result is not known with certainty. Wc conjectured the following:
the range depends also on the position of the rocket at fuel cut-off. If now the
thrust (especially after its reduction) is too weak, the rocket travels for a longer
time and therefore over a greater distance than originally intended, until it
reaches the fuel cut-off velocity. In the case of the radio-method, this causes an
error in range only, whereas with the IG-method an error in time is introduced
due to the influence of gravity. This error, as can be seen from equation (2.2),
87
O. Muller, The Control System of the V-2
operates in the opposite direction. Whether this compensation
actually
improved the accuracy noticeable is not auite clear.
Part of the observed deviation is naturally caused by the wind and other
influences during the time of free flight. The error thus caused was estimated
at a few hundred meters.
The influence of the rotation of the earth on the trajectory (some kilometres)
made the use of range tables necessary.
3. THE GUIDE PLANE CONTROL OE THE SPECIAL SERIES
3.1.
D e s c r i p t i o n
As already mentioned, the rocket, if controlled by the automatic pilot only,
will drift laterally under the influence of lateral forces. On an average this
causes a considerable deviation. If, at the instant of fuel cut-off, the rocket has
a velocity of say, 1400 m/sec corresponding to an approximate range of 250 km
and the lateral wind has an assumed velocity of 20 m/sec, an error in line of
about 3.5 km is to be expected. Further noticeable lateral deviations must be
expected as a result of the wandering of the course gyro, and asymmetries in
thrust. In order to reduce these inaccuracies, some of the V-2 rockets were
equipped with guide-plane control. It had been demanded that this control
should operate through an additional signal to the automatic pilot. It was
intended to operate the rockets with automatic pilot only in the case of inter-
ference. Furthermore production problems caused that demand. It may be
mentioned here that the radio connection to the V-2 was never jammed.

The guide-plane was produced as follows (Fig. 9): A transmitter with a
Frequency of about 50 mc/sec was positioned at a distance of 10 km behind the
launching base, so that transmitter and launching base were contained in the
plane intended as guide-plane. The transmitter fed two horizontal dipoles
positioned at a distance of about 200 metres from each other. The feeding into
the connecting line of the two aerials was effected alternately at two points
which had the same distance from the nearer aerial and the distance of about

characteristics a and b were obtained alternately (the parasitic lobes are
suppressed). At the receiver input onc obtained a square modulated voltage
whose depth of modulation was very approximately proportional to the angle ,
formed by the straightline transmitter—receiver with the guide-plane. An
additional modulation of the transmitter of 7 kc/sec made it possible to find
out whether the receiver was to the right or to the left of the guide-plane.
The position of the guide-plane was monitored by a control receiver
arranged in the desired direction of the guide-plane. At the receiver output in
the rocket a voltage was obtained whose positive or negative sign depended on
the lateral position (right or left) of the rocket and was proportional to its
angular position e. This voltage was, via a stabilizer network, fed into the
amplifier for the control in yaw. This network formed beside the t signal also
an isodrome control because, in the case of a pure angle control (including its
derivatives), the rocket, under the influence of lateral forces or of a gyro
deviation, travels at a certain distance parallel to the guide-plane. The isodrome
signal destabilized the rocket and therefore had to be chosen sufficiently weak.
The guide-plane system was, like all other radio equipments for the V-2,
developed tor ten frequencies in order to dodge interference.

Now wc shall consider the problem of finding a suitable form of control
equations. The three dimensional motion of a rocket with its six degrees of
freedom can be described by six simultaneous differential equations of the
second order. The coupling of these equations is considerably reduced if the
rocket — like the V-2 — does not roll (this was another reason for aiming at
a good stability in roll). It was found that the remaining coupling between pitch
and yaw control could be neglected for a rocket with the aerodynamic
diaractcristics and the trajectory of the V-2, so that the motion of the V-2 could
be considered separately in each plane.
89
O. Muller, The Control System of the V-2
The stability problem is nearly identical for yaw, pitch and roll. Therefore
we shall consider in dctril how the equation for control in yaw was obtained,
because in this case the additional problem of lateral control by guide-plane
had to be dealt with.

The oscillation about the centre of gravity is additionally damped in the first
case by the first, in the second case by the second differential quotient of the
control equation. The servo unit was originally rate-coordinated, however, the
net hinge-moments of the control vanes actually make m„ somewhat different
from zero. It is therefore probable that a signal of the form a 0(l + a l ap
I a.,„p'2) produces good stability. Naturally, a„ would have to be present in the
signal even if it effected destabilization, since it determines the assigned course
ot tbc automatic pilot.
The terms in the denominator are unavoidable if a passive control network is
used. In the final calculation of an optional transfer function for the signal,
they naturally had to be considered; moreover, the coefficient m.. carried
considerable weight. As mentioned above a network was developed according
to equation (3.6), which permitted the control characteristics to be kept constant
during the entire control period.
Based on similar considerations, it was at first assumed that the guide-plane
signal had also to be formed by a double differentiating network. However,
the calculations showed that single differentiation was sufficient. Since, in the
case of the guide-plane control, the controlled motion of the rocket is
represented
by
two
simultaneous
differential
equations,
the
Stability
calculations become far more extensive than those for the automatic pilot.
Moreover, they are less reliable because such calculations can be carried out in
practice only for equations with constant coefficients. This is permissible for the
automatic pilot because the oscillation about the centre of gravity is sufficiently
rapid; however, in the case of the guide-plane control the values thus obtained
appear rather questionable because the oscillation of the centre of gravity is
very slow. It was found, however, that these calculations give quite a good idea
of the stability of the guide-plane control. Control characteristics and transfer
functions for the first guide-plane controlled rockets were determined by means
of such calculations and produced satisfactory stability.
It was found that during the control period the transfer function could be
kept constant, but that the amplification
had to be varied. This was
accomplished by a cam gear-driven-potcntiomcter at the input of the yaw
control amplifier.
The fact that the end of the propelled part of the trajectory e„ had to be
varied considerably, unfortunately destroyed to a great extent the effect of
the isodromc control, which was also proportional to e„. It was not possible to
develop methods avoiding this disadvantage.
The denominator term of the guide-plane signal calls for the following
remarks: while the denominator terms of the automatic pilot system signal were

chosen so small — they were regarded as undesirable — as was technically
permissible (attenuation factor of the network) 7, was chosen as large as
possible in order to filter the signal, but without jeopardizing the stability of the
control: the possibility of interference was to be reduced. In the end, filtering
was still carried further by a guide-plane signal of the type (approximately)

In spite of many efforts we did not succeed in making the lateral control of
the rocket really stable during the last seconds before all-burnt. Although the
rocket always remained in close proximity to the guide-plane, wc often
observed an angle between the trajectory tangent at all-burnt and the guide-
plane, which could not be neglected.
The systems of equations for the control in roll and pitch are somewhat
different from those for the control in yaw, but the difference is not material
and, therefore, wc do not consider them here.

The numerical investigations of the stability problem were almost exclusively
carried out by the method of small disturbances, i.e. the roots of the charac-
teristic equation of the system of differential equations were examined. For this
purpose, the method of examining the determinant of the highest order did
not appear to be particularly suitable; instead, damping regimes were calculated
specially, by a method using the conditions for the coefficients. The results ot
this method may be explained in a few words: if for instance the other
coefficients of the guide-plane control are given, the limits are obtained with
which b t and b,a may be chosen, if the damping of the oscillation should not be
less than a certain value. In principle, the method requires a considerable
amount ot calculation; however, approximate methods were developed to
reduce the labour.
Investigations into the stability were also carried out with the help ot the
NYQUIST method, but this was not so popular.
The stability of the pure automatic pilot control was also investigated with
the help of an electro-mechanical analogue computer, because it was not
possible to consider the backlask of the servo-unit and the non-linearities in the
calculation. The computer was a kind of moving-coil voltmeter (Fig. 12) whose
pointer had been enlarged to a pendulum. A small eddy current brake made it
possible to adjust the damping of the oscillations of the pendulum. By tilting
the pendulum in a plane perpendicular to its axis, its natural frequency could
be altered. The following equation was obtained for the free oscillations of the
pendulum:

The design data were chosen in such a way as to give the pendulum the
particular natural frequency and damping characteristic for the rocket in any
point of the controlled part of its trajectory.
In order to investigate the stability of the control system a voltage was
determined, with the help of a potentiometer, which was proportional to the
angle (/• between the axis of the pendulum and the vertical (the arrangement
was such that this angle was identical with the angle </• between the axis of the
rocket and its assigned course). This voltage was fed into a mixer unit which
operated the servo-unit. The servo-unit carried a potentiometer which produced
a voltage proportional to the deflection fi of the controller this voltage
exercised a proportional torque on the pendulum. The hinge-moment set up at
the servo-unit during flight was imitated by a spring coupling. According to the
above the equations for the whole system were:

this being identical with the system of equations for the pure automatic pilot
control. It was observed how the system returned to zero after a disturbance.
The imitation of the system of equations for the guide-plane control seemed
to be practically impossible in an electro-mechanical analogue computer,
especially because the coefficients had to be variable with time. Therefore an
electronic analogue computer
had
to be developed
for
these
stability
investigations. This contained essentially a number of integrators and potentio-
meters operated by cam shafts. It was possible with the help of these potentio-
meters to reproduce the variation with time of the coefficients of the system

The analogue computer thus imitates the equations of the motion of the
rocket. The control equation (3.6) is represented by the control elements
themselves.
It should be mentioned that the servo-unit was loaded by a leaf spring whose
point of support was varied with time in such a way as to imitate the hinge-
moment correctly at any time.
Between the output of the analogue computer and the input of the guide-
plane receiver which, according to section 3.1, supplies at its output the sum of
the actual guide-beam signal and of the isodrome signal was installed a specially
developed control generator. By the voltage ,
/. r(t) this generator was
modulated so that at its output it delivered a voltage curve corresponding to
the one occurring at the input of a receiver placed at the angular distance ,
from the guide-plane (see Fig. 10).

amplification of the feed-back-loop is somewhat different from 1 the integration

the time constant greater than ten minutes for half an hour if the resistance R
was not too small.

voltages. The input voltages were summed up, the total voltage rectified with
a phase-sensitive detector, then the integration carried out and finally the
integrated value used to modulate at 500 c sec suppressed carrier system (see
Fig. 15). The feeding back as described above was carried out with 500 c/sec
from output to input of the integrator.

The operation of the computer was made rather difficult by the necessity of
changing a cam shaft if the time function of the coefficient was to be altered.
It was therefore intended to equip the potentiometers with step-by-step
selectors and to operate these with the help of perforated tape.
The investigations carried out with the electronic analogue computer were of
great importance, especially for the solution of the problem of finding the
optimum control characteristic and the optimum transfer function for the guide-
plane control,

The probable error of the rockets with guide-plane control was within onc or
two kilometres. This error was caused mainly by the angle between the direction
of the trajectory tangent at all-burnt and the guide-plane (deviation of 0.1"
causes in the case of a range of 250 km a lateral deviation of about 400 m).
We were convinced that the probable error would be considerably below one

km if the problem of improving the damping of the control immediately
before all-burnt could be solved.
4. HIGH PRECISION CONTROL WITHOUT RADIO
4.1. D e s c r i p t i o n
The integration units had been developed for a V-2-control without radio.
But a combination of the described control system with a fuel cut-off unit
containing an integrator fixed to the rocket axis could not be expected to
produce good accuracy, for the following reasons:
a) The gyros precessed too much under the influence of the considerable
accelerations.
b) The integration of the axial acceleration, and the use of the integrated value
for the cut-off signal is, as wc have seen, not very advantageous. — More-
over, wc had no idea how to supplement this control system by an
additional lateral guidance.
In order to remedy this, the following control system without radio was
developed: A stabilized platform in Cardan suspension was built into the
rocket. By means of three gyros this platform did not alter its direction in space.
The angles between the three rocket axes and the platform were used as control
quantities for the automatic pilot. Such a platform has a much better stability
than a single gyro.
The pick-up of the integrator was mounted on this platform in such a way as
to measure the component of the rocket acceleration in the direction a, which
was used as measuring direction for the measurement of the rocket velocity by
radio. Thus the determination of the fuel cut-off time by means of the
integrator becomes theoretically equivalent to its determination by means of
radio measurement. Only objection: the term for the correction of gravity
which takes the form of
(4.1)
vg = gcos«-r/
is exact only if the time t, up to all-burnt docs not differ from its value <,* used
in the calculation.
For additional lateral guidance — substitute for guide-plane control — a
so-called lateral integrator was developed. An acceleration pick-up was
mounted on the stabilized platform in such a way as to measure the acceleration
perpendicular to the plane of the trajectory. The pick-up produced a current
proportional to this acceleration. A network which in principle performed a
double integration of this current yielded the expression
(4.2)
b u z { \ + h 1 0 p )
which was used for the control instead of the guide-plane signal. It was not
intended to use an integral signal for the time being. The probable error of
the firings without additional guidance (only a limited number was available)
amounted to
x M = ± 3.4 km,
250 = ± 2.7 km.
97
O. Muller, The Control System of the V-2
These rockets were equipped with the electronic integrator. The additional
lateral guidance by means of the lateral integrator could only be tried once. The
result was a lateral deviation of 0.5 km.

Fig. 16 is a basic diagram of the stabilized platform. Each of the three gyros
has one degree of freedom. If, due to a rotation of the Cardan suspension, a
friction torque becomes effective, the respective gyro begins to precess and
exerts on the platform a torque of equal magnitude in the opposite direction.

The platform retains its direction in space. If the gyro has precesscd through
a certain angle it closes a contact supplying current to the respective supporting
motor. This motor then exerts a torque on the platform greater than the
possible friction torque. The gyro begins to vibrate around its precession axis.
The platform too vibrates somewhat, but the amplitude of its vibration is
negligibly small. For good stability of the platform it is essential that the gyros
have very little friction about their precession axis.
The change of direction in pitch was carried out as follows: a motor rotated
the platform relative to the outer casing of its needle bearings. Naturally, the
Cardan suspension ring rotates and not the platform. The potentiometer D
supplies a voltage to the servo-units and the rocket changes its direction until
the original constellation of longitudinal axis of the rocket and the Cardan
suspension ring has been restored.
The simple co-ordination of gyro and supporting motor on which our
description is based, no longer holds in the case of the changes in direction,
but this is not a fundamental difficulty.

Fig. 17 shows the lateral integrator. A moving coil which dips into a magnet
- the system was similar to a permanent dynamic loudspeaker — was built
into the zero branch line of an emergency bridge circuit. Between the opposite
points of the bridge and the moving coil is a network. One of the branches of
the bridge is replaced by a switch which opens if the depth of the moving coil
in the magnet exceeds a certain value. If the apparatus is switched on the coil
vibrates with a relatively high frequency about the position thus determined.
The mean value of the current in the coil is proportional to the acceleration
exerted on the coil in the direction of its axis. Its polarity changes with the
direction of the acceleration i, — d iz/dt-.

The voltage U-, thus contains a component proportional to z and another
proportional to dz/dt. A signal was obtained similar to the one supplied by
the guide-plane receiver, feeding U.. into an amplifier whose gain was
varied by means of a cam shaft driven potentiometer. The output voltage of the
amplifier was fed into the mixer unit.
A moving coil system pick-up would have given too large a systematic error.
A component of the longitudinal acceleration proportional to the angle of
deflection would have been included in the measurement. If a system had been
chosen which avoided the vibration of the moving coil, friction would have
been intolerable.
5. SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE CONTROL OF THE V-2 WHICH
WAS IN COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT
5.1. T h e G u i d e - L i n e C o n t r o l
To protect the radio yaw control better against interference and also in order
to make a radio pitch control possible, i. e. a control in two planes vertical to
each other, a guide-line system in the 50 cm band was developed.
A continuous wave-transmitter fed the antenna equipment of a radar set, i. e.
a dipole rotating eccentrically within a parabolic reflector. The airborne
receiver determined the angular distance between the pilot beam and the radius
vector to the rocket as an altitude component et and a lateral component i,.
It was similar in operation to the receiver of the radar sets. Due to the
horizontal polarization of its aerial, the output voltage of the receiver —
making certain approximations — was
(5.1)
(7S = ki (2 £t- sin to t + £h cos OJ t) + ku cos 2 ai t,
where <o — frequency of rotation of dipole. The term k\ is led to two phase-
sensitive rectifier circuits, into which are fed additional voltages k\\\ cos iot
and km sin mt respectively. At the output the circuits supplied directional
voltages proportional to e* and e„ in amplitude. The voltages k\\\cosait and
k\\\ sin vi t were obtained from ^H cos 2 cut by frequency division. Since no
experience was available as to how a guide-plane control device would behave
when the guide-plane was being turned, the first lay-out of this set was planned
so that the yaw control signal would control the rocket laterally, whereas the
pitch control signal was transferred to the ground and this made the reflector
follow the rockel vertically. This set was under trial, but has not yet been used
for the actual control of a rocket. We were anxious to know whether the
mechanical accuracy of the large 7 m parabolic mirror would be sufficient for
following the change of direction without trouble.
A radio pitch control would have had the important advantage that the
location of the stationary equipment on the ground would have become
uncritical for the radio measurement of the velocity.

The range of the V-2 depended, apart from the all-burnt velocity and its
direction, primarily upon the co-ordinates of the all-burnt spot x. and y v which

(E2 = a numerical value). Transforming this equation as was done with

(5.3)
X = ktv,. + k..r, + E,,
(5-4)
ka = V T + (Jlfdyf,
(5.5)
cot 5 = dfldy.
Thus it is sufficient to measure the component r,\ of the distance covered by
the rocket in a direction inclined at an angle <) with the vertical, and at an
angle fr) with the relevant plane of yaw control, and to consider this component
aa the so-called "way-correction", when determining the all-burnt point. The
electronic "longitudinal integration method" makes it possible to determine
r,\ in a simple manner: a second pick-up, which measures the acceleration in the
direction i), is placed on the stabilized platform, and the resulting current is
integrated twice.
The radio measurement supplied the way-correction with
satisfactory
accuracy provided a second receiver unit was placed not too far away from
the launching base. Labour developments were under way to incorporate the
way-correction k* r.s, in both cut-off procedures.
With the radio cut-off procedure the way-correction factor was used to
alter the frequency of the WIEN bridge. With the integrator cut-off procedure
it was intended to unload additionally, by a current proportional to the twice
integrated measurement current, the electrolytic cell, which caused fuel cut-off
when the charge passed through zero.
The additional equipment necessitated by the introduction of the way-
correction was rather bulky. Devices were developed, therefore, which
introduced, instead of a way-correction, a time-correction into the switching-
off circuits.
The deviation of the distance all-burnt point-launching base from its
calculated value was approximately proportional to the difference between
the time required for the flight and its assigned value f, — t%*.
Instead of (5.3) we can, therefore, write approximately
(5.6)
X ~ k, v„ + k3 (t, — t,*) + £,.
With regard to the radio cut-off procedure, the frequency of the WIEN bridge
was changed by a synchron-motor which began to rotate at the moment of
launching. The first firing tests with this arrangement yielded satisfactory
results.
With regard to the integration procedures, it was intended to change the
position of the switching contact (IG 1) by a synchron-motor so as to send a
constant additional current through the electrolytic cell (IG 2). These develop-
ments were not very far advanced, although a time-correction would have
considerably reduced the apparent velocity compensation error which is also
proportional to tt — tt*.
